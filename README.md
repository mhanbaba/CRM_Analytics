CRM is the set of methods used by companies to make their relationship with existing or potential customers the most efficient, effective and ultimately most profitable.

In order to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in customer relations, it is necessary to first understand what the customer needs, to develop products suitable for this need, and then to present the product to the right customer, at the right time and at the right price.

With data science applications in CRM, the entire customer relations process is tried to be handled more efficiently based on data.

In summary, there are efforts to sell more products, create more loyal customers, find new customers and sell new products in CRM.
